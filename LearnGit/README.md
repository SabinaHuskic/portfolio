# Learning Git & GitHub

This document summarizes what I’ve learned while exploring **Git** and **GitHub**.

---

## Getting Started with Git

### **1. Initialize a Repository**

```bash
git init
```

* Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.
* Run this **once per project** — initializing a repository inside another can cause issues.
* This command creates a hidden directory called `.git`, which tracks all version history and changes.

---

### **2. Check Repository Status**

```bash
git status
```

* Shows whether you are currently inside a Git repository.
* Displays which files are **untracked**, **modified**, or **staged** for commit.

---

## Creating a Repository

### **Option 1: Locally via Command Line**

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Use `git status` to make sure you’re not already inside another repo.
3. Initialize it with `git init`.

---

### **Option 2: On GitHub**

When creating a new repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com):

* You can add a **README.md** file.
* You can add a **.gitignore** file to tell Git which files **not** to track (e.g., databases, large files, API keys).
* You can choose a **license** to specify how others can use your code.

## Cloning a Repository

Ways to get a repository from GitHub to your local machine:

1. **Download as ZIP** – quick and simple, great for offline use or putting it on a USB.
2. **Use GitHub Desktop** – graphical interface for managing repositories.
3. **Use HTTPS and Git Clone** – the most common way:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

This copies the GitHub repository to your local machine.

---

## Creating a Private Repository

The process is the same as creating a public one — simply check the **“Private”** box when setting it up on GitHub.

---

## Cloning with Authentication

Before cloning private repositories, you need to authenticate with GitHub.

### **Option 1: Personal Access Token (PAT)**

1. Go to **Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens** on GitHub.
2. Generate a new token and select the **`repo`** scope for full control.
3. Use it in your clone command:

```bash
git clone https://<token>@github.com/username/repository.git
```

### **Option 2: GitHub Desktop**

* Go to **File → Clone Repository**.
* Choose your repository and local save location.
* GitHub Desktop handles authentication for you.

## Git Workflow & Usage

Each time you make changes, you must **commit** them so Git can track your progress.

### **Basic Workflow**

1. **Stage changes**

   ```bash
   git add filename.py      # Add specific file
   git add .                # Add everything in the directory
   ```

   This moves your changes to the **staging area** — not yet committed.

2. **Commit changes**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature X"
   ```

   Commits changes to the local repository with a meaningful message.

3. **Push to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   Uploads your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

---

## Working with Remote Branches

### **Check Remotes**

```bash
git remote -v
```

Shows the remote repository URLs connected to your local project.

### **Add a Remote Repository**

When pushing an existing local repository to GitHub, use:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

* `origin` is the conventional name for the main remote.
* Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### **Manage Remotes**

```bash
git remote rename oldname newname     # Rename a remote
git remote remove name                # Remove a remote connection
```

---

## Fetch vs. Pull

Two ways to get updates from a remote branch:

### **`git pull`**

* Downloads **and merges** changes directly into your current branch.
* Immediately updates your working directory files.

### **`git fetch`**

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

* Downloads updates **without merging** them into your current files.
* Lets you review changes first — useful for collaboration.
