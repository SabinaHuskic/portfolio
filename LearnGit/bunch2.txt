Example text for adding all your changes to the staging area using 'git add .'

this is if you are a solo developer and not being too carefull. 
Depending on your workflow this can be good or bad. 
Sometimes you want to be a little more precise and carefull to be able to roll back changes more individually.
Now that these files are part of the same stage, if I have to roll this back, I have to roll back both text files instead of just one at a time.

It is good practice to add files as you create them.
